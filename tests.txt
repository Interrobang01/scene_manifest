I'll help you create a manual testing checklist for your scene_manifest UI project. Since this is a UI-focused project, manual testing is indeed often more appropriate than automated tests.

First, let me understand more about your project to create a relevant testing list. Now let's look at the main functionality in the main.lua file: Let's look at more important files to understand the functionality: Let me check the info_functions.lua file too: Based on the files I've examined, I've got a good understanding of the scene_manifest UI. Now I'll create a comprehensive manual testing checklist for you.

# Manual Testing Checklist for Scene Manifest UI

## Basic Functionality Tests

1. **UI Launch and Display**
   - [ ] Verify the scene manifest UI displays correctly when opened
   - [ ] Check that the UI title and elements are properly aligned
   - [ ] Confirm the UI is responsive and scales appropriately with different window sizes

2. **Scene Object Display**
   - [ ] Verify objects in the scene appear in the manifest
   - [ ] Confirm objects are sorted correctly by X position
   - [ ] Verify object names/identifiers display correctly
   - [ ] Check that object types are correctly labeled

3. **Pagination**
   - [ ] Verify correct number of items per page (should be 10)
   - [ ] Test navigation between pages using the pagination controls
   - [ ] Confirm first page loads correctly with the proper items
   - [ ] Test navigation to last page shows correct items
   - [ ] Verify page count displays correctly
   - [ ] Test pagination when there are fewer items than page size
   - [ ] Test pagination when there are many items across multiple pages

4. **Filtering**
   - [ ] Test toggling between showing objects and attachments
   - [ ] Verify show_objects filter works correctly
   - [ ] Verify show_attachments filter works correctly
   - [ ] Test combining both filters to show all entities

## Object Manipulation Tests

1. **Selection**
   - [ ] Verify objects can be selected from the list
   - [ ] Test selection indication is visible and clear
   - [ ] Verify selected object's properties are displayed correctly

2. **Navigation ("Go" Button)**
   - [ ] Test "Go" button to verify camera moves to the selected object
   - [ ] Verify camera position is accurate after "Go" button is pressed
   - [ ] Test "Go" button with objects at different positions in the scene

3. **Copy Function**
   - [ ] Test "Copy" button functionality
   - [ ] Verify an object can be copied correctly
   - [ ] Check that the copied object can be pasted/used elsewhere
   - [ ] Verify the correct properties are maintained in the copied object

4. **Object Properties**
   - [ ] Verify object shape information displays correctly
   - [ ] Test changing shape properties (for box objects: width, height)
   - [ ] Verify color information displays correctly
   - [ ] Test changing object color properties
   - [ ] Verify position information is accurate
   - [ ] Test modifying position values
   - [ ] Check that changes persist after navigating away and back

## Edge Cases

1. **Empty Scene**
   - [ ] Test UI behavior when the scene has no objects or attachments
   - [ ] Verify appropriate messaging is shown when no items are found

2. **Large Scene**
   - [ ] Test performance with many objects in the scene (50+)
   - [ ] Verify pagination works correctly with large numbers of objects
   - [ ] Check sorting performance with many objects

3. **Object Types**
   - [ ] Test with various object shapes (box, sphere, etc.)
   - [ ] Verify specialized properties for different object types display correctly
   - [ ] Test with attachments of various types

4. **UI Responsiveness**
   - [ ] Verify UI remains responsive when manipulating large objects
   - [ ] Test UI behavior during scene modifications (adding/removing objects)
   - [ ] Check refresh functionality updates the list correctly

## Serialization Tests

1. **Pin Serialization**
   - [ ] Test serialize_pin functionality
   - [ ] Verify deserialization works correctly
   - [ ] Test serialization with complex objects
   - [ ] Check unique ID generation for serialized objects

2. **Scene Saving/Loading**
   - [ ] Verify scene objects persist correctly when saving and loading the scene
   - [ ] Test that modified properties are saved correctly

## Visual and UX Tests

1. **Visual Appearance**
   - [ ] Verify UI elements use consistent styling
   - [ ] Check color indicators show accurately
   - [ ] Verify icons (like clipboard.png) display correctly

2. **User Experience**
   - [ ] Test keyboard navigation within the UI
   - [ ] Verify tooltips or help text are present where needed
   - [ ] Check for appropriate feedback when actions are performed

## Integration Tests

1. **Interaction with Scene**
   - [ ] Verify changes made in the manifest affect the scene in real-time
   - [ ] Test that scene modifications outside the manifest are reflected in the UI after refresh
   - [ ] Verify the refresh function updates all object properties correctly

2. **Interaction with other Simulo features**
   - [ ] Test compatibility with other Simulo packages if possible
   - [ ] Verify the manifest doesn't interfere with other UI elements

## Documentation Test

1. **README Verification**
   - [ ] Confirm the README accurately describes the functionality
   - [ ] Verify any usage instructions match actual behavior

This manual testing checklist covers the key functionality of your scene_manifest UI. Since this is a UI-based project working with a game/simulation environment, manual testing is indeed more appropriate than automated tests.

Would you like me to create a file with this checklist that you can include in your project for future reference?
